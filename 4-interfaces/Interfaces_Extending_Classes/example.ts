// When an interface type extends a class type it inherits the members of the class but not their implementations. It is as if the interface had declared all of the members of the class without providing an implementation. Interfaces inherit even the private and protected members of a base class. This means that when you create an interface that extends a class with private or protected members, that interface type can only be implemented by that class or a subclass of it.
//
// This is useful when you have a large inheritance hierarchy, but want to specify that your code works with only subclasses that have certain properties. The subclasses donâ€™t have to be related besides inheriting from the base class. For example:


class Control {
    private state: any;
}

interface SelectableControl extends Control {
    select(): void;
}

class Button extends Control implements SelectableControl {
    select() { }
}

class TextBox extends Control {

}

// Error: Property 'state' is missing in type 'Image'.
class Image implements SelectableControl {
    select() { }
}

class Location {

}
